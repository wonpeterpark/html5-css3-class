1901 - 1910
In 1902, the Board of Regents made University Extension an autonomous department under the
leadership of the former Cornell history professor Henry Morse Stephens. Stephens was a fervent
supporter of the original ideology of university extension’s: “I am longing to try my hand on a great
Extension scheme on the Oxford line - I know I can do it and make a success of it.” In contrast to the
initial ‘free lectures’ model of Gayley and his colleagues, Stephens designed and organized lecturesto meet the needs and interests of adult professionals across the state. This model was operating
largely independently of the Academic Senate, used mainly non-faculty lecturers offering non-credit
courses, and was self-funded through a subscription model. With this extremely agile and
student-centric model, he created the fundamental concept of Continuing Education as we know it
today. The success of this model and his own energy, engagement and popularity, allowed
corresExtension to grow exponentially, reaching its peak of 15 centers around the state of California
in 1905. However, when Stephens continued his career with other university appointments after
1905, Extension activities declined until they ultimately ceased in 1910.
