A woman student waiting for a train on Shattuck
Avenue. The train station stood where buildings
stand on "Shattuck Square" today, near the
Berkeley BART (rapid transit) station. The trains
brought commuters, including many students, to
and from the Oakland waterfront where they
could catch ferries to San Francisco.
