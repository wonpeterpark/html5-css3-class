In 1891, Berkeley faculty started teaching courses in history, philosophy, mathematics andEnglish to the public in San Francisco, with great success (over 800 learners in the first fallsemester). This initiative came to life as a reaction to calls from the Californian people tomake the university’s education offerings more accessible and to fully embrace its missionas a land grant university. Indeed, until today, the University of California is bound “to servesociety as a center of higher learning, providing long-term societal benefits throughtransmitting advanced knowledge, discovering new knowledge, and functioning as anactive working repository of organized knowledge”​1​. For the founders of the university’sExtension, this mission meant providing access to learners of all ages and as aconsequence, they pioneered the uniquely American concept of lifelong learning throughcontinuing education. In fact, the name of ‘lifelong learning’ was coined by one ofExtension's first deans, Sean J. Richardson.The reason for the creation of the University of California as well as its Extension in the late19th century, was to accelerate the economic development of California to catch up withthe roaring industrialization on the East Coast (Picture 1). However, before Extension wasborn, the university consisted only of a few posh buildings and a theater on a remote hill, inthe vicinity of the sleepy East Bay town of Berkeley (Picture 2). Privileged sons anddaughters of wealthy families were studying and preparing themselves for high levelpositions in research, politics, public administration, and business. With the idea to giveaccess to its excellent educational offerings to people of all ages, who would attend a singlecourse at a time, while working, Extension breached the gap of academia and professionalworld, and created one the most advanced and successful continuing educationdepartment in history.
