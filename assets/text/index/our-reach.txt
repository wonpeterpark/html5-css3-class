The central concept of Extension, as envisioned by it’s first proponents, notably the two UCPresidents, Edward S. Holden and Horace Davis, has always been the accessibility to thecourses offered by our instructors. Consequently, Extension courses took place where thelearners worked and lived, not on the remote campus in Berkeley. After the immediatesuccess of its first courses, the regents officially adopted an extramural instruction planthat formally established the University Extension on Valentine’s Day, February 14, 1893.The concept of accessibility and the willingness to go towards the learners led Extension toconstantly innovate new ways of reaching learners, for example, in 1928 Extension teacheson commuter trains, in 1945 Extension taught over 26,000 learners via its correspondencecourses, in 1994 Extension ventures into online education and in 2012 Extension createsthe UC’s first online course production department BRCO.Today,inpartduetotheglobalpandemic,Extensionhasdevelopedthecapacitytoreachlearnersbeyondthebayareawithliveinstruction.Learnersfromanywhereintheworldarenowabletojoinourcoursesandwecanhelpthem,tolaunchorchangetheircareers,to support their families, and share their knowledge and the Berkeley mindset.
