                <p>By the early 1950s, the model of a typical extension student was someone who already at least had
                 some higher education. About 80% had college experience, 40% had earned a bachelor's degree;
                 and 67% were employed professional, semi professional or managerial occupations. Under the
                 direction of Professor Woods, UC Extension moved successfully in two directions at once: First, it
                 began offering "useful training" unrelated to traditional degree course offerings, and second, it
                 shifted the emphasis of the class program from lower-division to upper-division and graduate work.
                 With appropriate involvement of the faculty, Extension began offering a graduate degree in
                 education in San Diego, and masters' degrees in engineering first at five centers in the south and
                 later in northern California as well. Propelled by the successful collaboration between Extension and
                 the university’s faculty, the number of Extension units grew rapidly: Riverside in 1954; San Diego in
                 1959; Davis in 1960</p>
